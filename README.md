This project will be a recreation of the home Google Search page. It might not be identical or completely functional but it's supposed to serve as practice for building something with HTML and using what I've learned so far.

I first started by trying to outline the entire HTML for the webpage. I soon realized that it made way more sense to start with the main elements, then go to both the navbar and footer (which is what the instructions would have told me if I had read carefully...). This project helped me to get past those initial moments where you want to bang your head against the wall. Figuring out how to make something do what you want it to is such a great feeling. Here's to more projects and moments of confusion and accomplishment.

Main things that I practiced:
Styling with CSS
Using flex to position things
HTML document structure
Using IDs and classes to stay organized/style individual things or groups
Google as a resource
